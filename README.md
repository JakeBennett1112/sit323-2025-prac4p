For Task 4.2C, I have expanded upon Task 4.1P and have added additional arithmetic operations. I chose to complete the examples found within the task sheet ie. exponentiaton, square root and modulo.
I added a comment towards the bottom of the code to state where I am starting the advanced operations
From here I copied the code from above and changed exp to n1**n2, sqrt to Math.sqrt(number) and mod to n1%n2.
I then tested it and have provided screenshots of the working tests in the attached work doc
